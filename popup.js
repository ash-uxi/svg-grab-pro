// This script handles any popup-specific functionality

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  // You could add event listeners for any buttons or links in the popup
  
  // For example, if we wanted to add a stats counter or settings in the future
  
  // For now, this is a minimal implementation since our core functionality
  // works through the context menu rather than the popup
  
  // You could fetch and display stats about how many SVGs have been copied/downloaded
  // if you implement that tracking feature in the future
